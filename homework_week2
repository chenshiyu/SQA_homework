summary of the content of week 2

  In the chapter of 4, we mainly discussed Defect Handling, QA in Software Processes, V&V Perspective. And discussed difference between Defect View and V&V View. Key of defect handling and tracking in the state, causal analysis, and defect removal to break the chain of causation. We also discussed the key defect identification and analysis. Software quality assurance activities throughout the whole process of software development needs, design, coding, testing, validation. No matter in which software process (such as the waterfall model, spiral model, iterative model), software quality assurance is very important. Quality assurance has different performance in different software process. For example, what it displays in the XP is test driven development. What in the spiral model is risk management. activities of quality assurance focus on quality defect treatment in the maintenance process.
  When we do more work on the basis of software quality assurance, it forms software quality engineering(Software quality engineering is the sublimation of quality assurance). These works includes planning and goal setting, management , assessment of quality/reliability. Of course it contains more detailed tasks in detail. 
  In the chapter of 6, we studied the test overview. Software testing is an important part of the software quality assurance. what issues are test mainly pays attention to? We can analyze from four aspects. First of all is “what”, we have to do quality individual vs. defect detection and removal. The second is “how”, it is what technology, activities and process we use in test. The third one is view, what perspective We classify tests from. Finally the exit, namely coverage vs..Usage - -based. Software testing technology mainly includes black box testing and white box testing, of course, there are some other test methods. We need to choose different test methods according to different stages.
